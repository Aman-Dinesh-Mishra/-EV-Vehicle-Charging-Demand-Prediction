# EV-Vehicle-Charging-Demand-Prediction 🚗⚡

This project aims to predict the demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using historical usage data and relevant features such as location, time, and vehicle type. The goal is to support smart infrastructure planning by identifying high-demand areas and optimizing resource allocation.

## 📌 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern discovery
- Predictive modeling using regression techniques
- Visualization of demand trends and model performance

## 📁 Contents
- `EV_VEHICLE_PREDICTIONipynb`: Main notebook with code and analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run all cells to view the analysis and predictions

## 📈 Future Scope
- Integration with real-time data feeds
- Deployment as a web-based dashboard
- Incorporation of weather and traffic data for enhanced accuracy
